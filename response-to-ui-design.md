Response to _Software UI Design_
================================
Shneiderman, Porter, and Portman present sets of rules for user interface design. The commonalities they share pivot on simplicity and consistency. Without these principles, the interface will be complex and unclear, making the user feel they are not in control. Users "don’t want surprises or changes in familiar behavior", as Shneiderman suggests, and both Porter and Portman emphasize that clarity on what something does, will do, and has done, will yield confidence in the user. Simplicity helps keep also the attention of user - "show only what is necessary on each screen" and keep the "core interface should be simple and functional", recommends Porter and Portman. Distractible material should be kept to a minimum and the primary function of the interface should be front and center, while all else is secondary and should be out of the way.

Additionally, they advise to design interfaces to be as flexible as possible for a diverse set of users. According to Portman, "account for all the devices and resolutions" while considering the many "possible content situations (no content, little content, ugly content, weird content)". Shneiderman, too, emphasizes universal usability and considering "novice to expert differences, age ranges, disabilities, and technological diversity".

I find [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) to be well designed. At first glance, it looks very basic and nearly harks back to websites of old. The point of this site is to easily share links and discuss all kinds topics and interests. Its a forum for all forums and does it very well due to its simplicity. Without an adblocker, there is only one ad that appears per page and is always off to the right side and are often only advertisements for other forums, or "subreddits". Information about the particular forum also only stays on the right side and the navigation is always along the very top. The main content itself always takes up 90% of the page and is in the middle. No matter which subreddit the user is in, the interface stays consistent across the entire website. This allows the user to easily learn how to navigate and use the site. This way, the user feels in control and is never too distracted by irrelevant ads and information. 

Interaction with the main content also stays consistent, simple, and easy to learn. Besides sharing content to the community, a user can upvote, downvote, and comment on content. Any other actions are secondary and are kept in the right sidebar. By only keeping the primary functions front and center, it is harder to misuse or misunderstand the website. This greatly helps the user during the "zero state", which Porter explains is "the first time experience with an interface". When one first experiences this website, most likely their first instinct will be to read over the endless blue links down the page and click on a title that piques their interest. They'll read it, scroll down and read the comments, have a laugh, go back to the main page and find another link. They'll probably see the up and down arrows beside each link and deduce, from familiarity with how other sites, like Facebook, work, that these arrows mean to upvote or downvote content (or, in other words, to "like" or "dislike"). After a while, the user will notice the extra information and links in the sidebars, as well as the list of subreddits that populate a tiny portion across the top of the page. I believe this is how reddit originally intended their site to be used, and it does it very well.
