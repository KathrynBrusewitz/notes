Nov 10 - Data Visualization
===
Typical Data Science Project  
---
1. Define a question you want to answer  
2. Design an empirical framework for answering it  
3. Gather data relevant to the question  
5. Clean the data  
5. Test hypotheses  
6. Communicate the results <- Data Visualization  

Two Forms of Data Visualization
---
1. Visually encoding the results of a data analysis in order to _communicate_ insights and tell stories  
2. Visually encoding data to facilitate visual exploration that may _generate_ new insights

Visual Encoding
---
Which visual properties work best? 
: Those that enable people to quickly and accurately 

Preattentive Perception
: Visual properties that humans distinguish immediately without even thinking about it.

Visual properties
: Orientation, length, width, size, shape, curvature, added marks, enclosure, shade, hue, 2d/3d position

Hue and shade might be hard to tell the difference if the difference in saturation is not enough. Animations add flicker, direction, and velocity

Designing a Data Visualization
---
1. What story do you want to tell about your data?  
2. Which data on which dimensions (x, y, z, time) and what kind of scale (linear, log, exponential)?  
3. Which data for each data point, and which visual encodings (shape, color, orientation, size, etc.)  
4. What labels, legends, annotations are needed?  


Nov 15 - Information Privacy
===
Privacy is less about protecting oneself against prying eyes, and more about the ability to control who gets to know
particular things about you. This control is essential to maintaining distinct categories of social relationships, and thus a particular social order

Descriptive vs Normative conceptions
---
Descriptive 
: Privacy is a condition to be achieved and maintained. “I need privacy to try on these clothes”

Normative 
: Privacy is a claim and moral obligation. “You must respect my privacy!”

Access vs Use
---
Access 
: I should be able to control who has access to my private information

Use 
: Even if I choose to reveal private information, I should still have control over how it can be used

"Right-to-be-forgotten"
---
Pro:

- “Information self-determination”
- If you don’t have privacy, you can’t organize dissent
- Small extension of existing information erasure laws
- Necessary to restore privacy we used to enjoy before the web
- Although lots of info is technically public, it requires context for proper understanding

Against:

- It’s censorship
- Bad solution to a real problem: too vague and too subjective
- Will be abused by those with money and power
- Google has an incentive to approve all requests

Nov 17 - Intellectual Property
===
Common Justifications for IP Rights
---
Loackean/Economic
: We want those who put lots of work into developing something new or innovative to benefit economically from their labor

Moral/Personal
: We want those who create new or innovative things to be able to control how their work is used and displayed

Utilitarian
: We want those who create new or innovative things to share their creations so that everyone can benefit from them in the long-run (US)

Copyrights
---
Protect various expressions, not ideas
: literary, musical, dramatic, choreographic, pictorial, graphical, sculptural, audiovisual, film, architectural, & computer software (but not fashion!)

Grant five exclusive rights
: reproduce, adapt, distribute, display, perform

Are subject to certain restrictions
: limited duration; first sale; fair use

As long as the expression is different, copyright is protected.  

Utility & Plant Patents
---
Protect useful and novel ideas, processes, or plants
: must be usable, novel, and non-obvious

Grant four exclusive rights
: make, use, sell, authorize others to sell
Are subject to certain restrictions
: public disclosure; limited duration (20 years)

Patents may be denied or revoked by demonstrating the existence of “prior art”

Design Patents
---
Protect new ornamental designs of functional objects
: must be novel & not contribute to function

Grant four exclusive rights
: make, use, sell, authorize others to sell

Are subject to certain restrictions
: public disclosure; limited duration (14 years) 

Trademarks
---
Protect unique marks associated with particular goods
: intent is to protect consumers from knock-offs

Grant the exclusive right to use the marks
: can sue anyone attaching marks to another product

Are subject to certain restrictions
: must be actively protected and cannot become generic (e.g., Aspirin, Escalator, Cellophane, Dry Ice, Flip Phone, Heroin, Linoleum, Thermos, Videotape)

Trade Secrets
---
Protect secrets that give a competitive advantage
: can be anything not widely known outside the company

Companies retain the right to make use of the secret
: not actually granted by the government; that would require disclosure, which kind of defeats the purpose

Are subject to certain restrictions
: once the secret is widely known, it’s no longer a secret... but a corporation can still sue the leaker for damages

Public Domain
---
That which is not protected by copyright, patent, trademark, or trade secret, and is freely available for use by anyone
without restrictions

For Quiz, know: Protections, Rights, and Restrictions for Copyrights, Patents, Trademarks, and Trade Secrets

Nov 22 - Digital Money
===
Money is a social information technology, something we invented to organize and reshape our social world

Two Primary Theories of Money
---
Commodity Theory 
: In Marx's theory, a commodity is something that is bought and sold, or exchanged in a market. It has an exchange value, meaning that a commodity can be traded for other commodities, and thus give its owner the benefit of others' labor (the labor done to produce the purchased commodity).

Credit Theory
: A sale and purchase is the exchange of a commodity for credit. From this main theory springs the sub-theory that the value of credit or money does not depend on the value of any metal or metals, but on the right which the creditor acquires to "payment," that is to say, to satisfaction for the credit, and on the obligation of the debtor to "pay" his debt and conversely on the right of the debtor to release himself from his debt by the tender of an equivalent debt owed by the creditor, and the obligation of the creditor to accept this tender in satisfaction of his credit.
