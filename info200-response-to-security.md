Response to _Security_
======================

Two-factor authentication was optional on his Google account, and possibly not even offered at the time on other popular services, such as Amazon, AppleID, and Twitter. Without two-factor authentication, there is nothing to double check whether your identity is legitimate. Once the first verification layer, such as a password entry, is passed, a second verification layer should be required to reduce the chances of account breaches. Honan had failed to turn on two-factor authentication on as many of his accounts as possible, which, I would argue, isn't entirely his fault, as the system design of all these services should have considered the security of users as a primary concern, and design with the fact in mind that the average will disregard steps to secure their credentials and accounts, if made optional, in favor of convenience.

Honan regrets not regularly backing up his data. However, it is possible that it is not entirely his fault for either forgetting or completely disregarding backing up his data. It might be better to design the systems and applications he used to manage his photos to have a backup system in place to the cloud, and is only turned off by choice. Or choosing what things to backup should be made easier, so that users do not find it too much work. Applications should encourage and remind (to an extent that it does not become annoying) to regularly backup important files. Otherwise, the system fails to fully consider all of the user experience, which encomposses not only their experience with using the app, but also the collateral effects of when things unintentionally happen in the application.

Probably most vital to point out is the most glaring operational problem this hack exposes: the customer service systems. 
Amazon tech support gave hackers the last four digits of Honan's credit card. Apple tech support had then deemed this information, paired with a billing address, as enough to give access to Honan's iCloud account. This form of identity verification is severely lacking, as it has obviously failed to protect Honan's accounts. This ease of being able to obtain information from one application and use it to gain access to another application exposes how flawed the current technology industry's data management and attempt at security is. Internal policies set by Apple were ignored or not followed completely by its very own tech support - policies which were specifically designed to protect users and their information. Verification of one's identity should not rely on small and impartial bits of information that are easily found, physically or on the web.

Whitten and Tygar claim that user interface design is a major problem in end-user email encryption software, and suspect that "domain-specific user interface design principles and techniques" (Whitten, 680) are needed to make security usable. They've identified problematic properites of security that affect its usability. First, users are generally unmotivated to learn about security. Second, security involves abstract rules and policies, which are alien and unintuitive for most users. Third, feedback on the state of security is generally complex and its difficult to give feedback on what the user actually wants to know. Fourth, because the security of the whole system depends on its weakest link, the user has to be guided through all aspects of their security to ensure nothing has been left unprotected for even a short time. 

Regarding the software they tested with users, PGP 5.0, they found that users may delete a private key (an irreversible action) without understanding the consequences, as the warning dialog they receive before deleting the key does not explain to the user what will exactly happen to the private key. Also, the user may choose to publicize a key to the key server without knowing it is an irreversible action and the key stays on the key server permanently. The user interface fails to inform what the results of their action will be. Additionally, there are problems with complexity presented to the user. PGP's simplest primary functions are signing and encryption, however Whitten and Tygar argue that PGP 5.0 does not do enough to "distinguish[...] between basic, intermediate, and advanced levels of key management activity so as not to overwhelm its users" (Whitten, 692). These problems make it difficult to use and understand encryption and what (not) to do in the software. 

Whitten and Tygar's suggest quickly communicating an accurate, yet smaller and simpler, conceptual model of the security to the user. This includes breaking down security functionality to what is truly necessary given the needs of the user, without sacrificing the integrity of security. The interface then must have carefully and accurately designed metaphors to match functionality. Additionally, easier, simpler methods to extensive tutorials must be investigated so that users can know how to make use of warning messages and other interactive tools.
