# TIL (Today I Learned)

> Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent, and original manner possible. - Richard Feynman

A collection of code and writings on small things I learn day to day. These don't really warrant a full blog post or their own repo, so I figure why not commit them here.

I borrowed this idea from [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).
